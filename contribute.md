## Import fork to Gitbook

To easily edit the project first [**fork the repo**](https://github.com/LucienHH/docs-xsapi) and then log in to Gitbook using your Github account.   
  
Create a new private space and call it XSAPI \(this isn't necessary but stays consistent\), once created head to **Integrations** and enable the Github integration.  
  
Select your forked repo, sync the master branch and make sure to select **I write my content on GitHub** as this will ensure it imports correctly  
  
****Congrats you've successfully forked the repo to Gitbook, once you've made any changes click save and merge it to your repo and then create a PR.
